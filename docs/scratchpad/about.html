<p class="about-text">
  Data at Work is about enabling an open 21st century workforce data ecosystem... by developing datasets, tools, standards,
  and best practices for publishing data on skills, jobs, and training. The heart of Data at Work is the Open Skills Project...
  Itâ€™s aim is to improve our understanding of the labor market and reduce frictions in the workforce data ecosystem by enabling
  a more granular common language of skills among industry, academia, government, and nonprofit organizations.
